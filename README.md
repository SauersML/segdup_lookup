## Quick start

Run the program like this:
```
mkdir segdup_lookup_folder && cd segdup_lookup_folder && git clone https://github.com/ScottSauers/segdup_lookup.git . && python3 main.py
```

# Segmental Duplication Lookup Tool

A Python tool to identify overlaps between gene coordinates and genomic segmental duplications.

## Overview

This tool performs two main functions:
1. Fetches gene coordinates from Ensembl for a predefined list of genes
2. Checks for overlaps between these genes and known segmental duplications

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Required packages: `pandas`, `requests`, `tqdm`

```pip3 install pandas tqdm requests```

## Installation

```bash
mkdir segdup_lookup_folder
cd segdup_lookup_folder
git clone https://github.com/ScottSauers/segdup_lookup.git .
```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will:
1. Download gene coordinates from Ensembl
2. Fetch segmental duplication data
3. Give information about overlaps between genes and duplications

## Output

- `overlap_results.csv`: Overlap information
-  `GPCR_output.csv`: Overlap information for GPCR-related genes
- `gene_coordinates_with_group_name.tsv`: Gene coordinates
- `gene_errors.log`: Any errors encountered during execution

A direct match means that the gene overlaps the duplication region directly, either on the primary duplication region or on the secondary (other) duplication region, but only if the gene's chromosome matches and the gene actually overlaps the coordinates of that region.

A non-direct match occurs if the gene overlaps a duplication region that is on a different chromosome (e.g., otherChrom) but is linked by duplication. Even if a gene overlaps a duplication on the same chromosome, if the duplication is in a completely different region (not overlapping), it's not a direct match.

For non-direct matches, the reported overlap region is not a true overlap on the geneâ€™s own chromosome and region. Essentially, it is measuring the amount of overlap if the gene were on that other region.

## Note

This script is untested and may contain inaccuracies or bugs. If an overlap type is primary but also other, it will be classified as primary. The output file may have duplicates.
